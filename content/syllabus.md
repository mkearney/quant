### Objectives
1. Provide an introduction to quantitative research methods commonly
   used in the study of journalism and mass communication with
   specific emphases on the a) formulation of questions, b) study 
   design, c) development of data collection methods, and d) 
   interpretation of data as answers to questions.
2. Develop the skills necessary to read, understand, critique, and
   write about mass communication research.
3. Provide an introduction to the uses of statistics.
4. Cultivate analytical thinking about theory and research both in
   theory and in practice.

### Goals
This class is designed to introduce graduate students to the most
common scientific research methods currently used in journalism and
mass communication. It is intended to be an introduction to the
systematic study of mass communication. Hence, the emphasis of this
course is on empirical studies and will examine research that
journalists often use and write about. It will also examine research 
conducted by journalism and mass communication scholars. This
course serves as baseline preparation for your continuing work in the
graduate program by providing you with a rigorous intellectual
experience in how studies are conducted, how to assess their validity
and reliability, issues regarding appropriate use of numbers and
statistics, and their relationship to the parts of the world they
attempt to explain.

### Texts
* All required readings will be linked or made available on Canvas
* You should also stay abreast of research in your interest area by
reading appropriate scholarly and professional journals, such as:
Communication Research, Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly,
Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Political Communication,
Public Opinion Quarterly, Journal of Communication, Journal of
Advertising, Newspaper Research Journal, Mass Communication Review

### Requirements
The class consists of weekly readings, completion of IRB certification, 
several homework assignments, a midterm exam, and a final written project.

### Research paper
The research paper (proposal) will be on a topic chosen by you, in
consultation with me. You are strongly encouraged to meet with me
outside of class to discuss your proposed research topic. The research
paper (proposal) will be due during finals week. The research
question for your research paper (proposal) is due around the mid-point
of the course calendar. Research proposal presentations will take place
prior to finals week---at the end of the semester. Although the final
paper (research proposal) must include a **brief** summary of
pertinent literature, identification of applicable theories and a
clear statement of the value of the study, the primary emphasis will
be on research design, methods, and plan of data analyses. Details
about the paper will be forthcoming.

## Grades

### Breakdown
The following is a percentage breakdown of the grades in this course:

| Assignment            | Percent  |
|-----------------------|:--------:|
| Midterm Exam          | 25%      |
| Research paper        | 25%      |
| Research presentation | 25%      |
| Homework assignments  | 25%      |
| **Total**             | **100%** |

### Scale
This course uses a plus/minus grading scale. Graduate students
cannot earn D's, thus earning less than 70% will result in a failing
grade.

| Percent     | Grade |
|-------------|-------|
| 93.4 - 100  | A     |
| 90.0 - 93.3 | A-    |
| 86.7 - 89.9 | B+    |
| 83.4 - 86.6 | B     |
| 80.0 - 83.3 | B-    |
| 76.7 - 79.9 | C+    |
| 73.4 - 76.6 | C     |
| 70.0 - 73.3 | C-    |
| 00.0 - 69.9 | F     |

Percentages are exact. I do not offer extra credit or give incompletes. 
If you have any questions or concerns about an assignment---the nature 
of it, the due date, etc.---it is best to ask them before completing the 
assignment. Given advanced notice and special circumstances, it may be 
possible to come to agreement on an alternative arrangement for an 
assignment, but you *must talk to me at least one week prior to the original due date*.

### Late Work
Homework assignments are due at the start of class on the assigned 
due date. Late work will result in a reduction in grade. The final
paper is due by midnight on the assigned due date. Late assignments
will be deducted points at a rate of 10% [of the original assigned
value] per 24 hours until it is either submitted or ceases to be worth
points.

The only exceptions to the late work policy will be in the case of a
documented emergency such as bereavement, extreme illness or medical
emergency, or some other catastrophic life event.

## Policies

### Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is fundamental to the activities and principles of
a university. All members of the academic community must be confident
that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired,
developed, and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to
all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. The
academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as
extremely serious matters. Sanctions for such a breach may include
academic sanctions from the instructor, including failing the course
for any violation, to disciplinary sanctions ranging from probation to
expulsion. When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting,
collaboration, or any other form of cheating, consult the course
instructor.

### ADA Compliance
If you anticipate barriers related to the format or requirements of
this course, if you have emergency medical information to share with
me, or if you need to make arrangements in case the building must be
evacuated, please let me know as soon as possible.

If disability related accommodations are necessary (for example, a
note taker, extended time on exams, captioning), please etablish an
accommodation plan with the MU Disability Center, S5 Memorial Union,
573-882-4696, and then notify me of your eligibility for reasonable
accommodations. For other MU resources for persons with disabilities,
click on "Disability Resources" on the MU homepage.

### Intellectual Pluralism
The University community welcomes intellectual diversity and respects
student rights. Students who have questions or concerns regarding the
atmosphere in this class (including respect for diverse opinions) may
contact the departmental chair or divisional director; the director of
the Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities; the MU Equity
Office, or [equity@missouri.edu](mailto:equity@missouri.edu).

All students will have the opportunity to submit an anonymous
evaluation of the instructor(s) at the end of the course.
