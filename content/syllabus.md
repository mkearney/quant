### Scale
This course uses a plus/minus grading scale. Graduate students
cannot earn D's, thus earning less than 70% will result in a failing
grade.

| 00.0 - 69.9 | F     |

Percentages are exact. I do not offer extra credit or give incompletes. 
If you have any questions or concerns about an assignment---the nature 
of it, the due date, etc.---it is best to ask them before completing the 
assignment. Given advanced notice and special circumstances, it may be 
possible to come to agreement on an alternative arrangement for an 
assignment, but you *must talk to me at least one week prior to the original due date*.

### Late Work
Homework assignments are due at the start of class on the assigned 
due date. Late work will result in a reduction in grade. The final
paper is due by midnight on the assigned due date. Late assignments
will be deducted points at a rate of 10% [of the original assigned
value] per 24 hours until it is either submitted or ceases to be worth
points.

The only exceptions to the late work policy will be in the case of a
documented emergency such as bereavement, extreme illness or medical
emergency, or some other catastrophic life event.

## Policies

### Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is fundamental to the activities and principles of
a university. All members of the academic community must be confident
that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired,
developed, and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to
all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. The
academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as
extremely serious matters. Sanctions for such a breach may include
academic sanctions from the instructor, including failing the course
for any violation, to disciplinary sanctions ranging from probation to
expulsion. When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting,
collaboration, or any other form of cheating, consult the course
instructor.

### ADA Compliance
If you anticipate barriers related to the format or requirements of
this course, if you have emergency medical information to share with
me, or if you need to make arrangements in case the building must be
evacuated, please let me know as soon as possible.

If disability related accommodations are necessary (for example, a
note taker, extended time on exams, captioning), please etablish an
accommodation plan with the MU Disability Center, S5 Memorial Union,
573-882-4696, and then notify me of your eligibility for reasonable
accommodations. For other MU resources for persons with disabilities,
click on "Disability Resources" on the MU homepage.

### Intellectual Pluralism
The University community welcomes intellectual diversity and respects
student rights. Students who have questions or concerns regarding the
atmosphere in this class (including respect for diverse opinions) may
contact the departmental chair or divisional director; the director of
the Office of Students Rights and Responsibilities; the MU Equity
Office, or [equity@missouri.edu](mailto:equity@missouri.edu).

All students will have the opportunity to submit an anonymous
evaluation of the instructor(s) at the end of the course.

of section 200.020 of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the

Those students who are permitted to record are not permitted to
redistribute audio or video recordings of statements or comments from
