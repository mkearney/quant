<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Provide an introduction to quantitative research methods commonly
   used in the study of journalism and mass communication with
   specific emphases on the a) formulation of questions, b) study 
   design, c) development of data collection methods, and d) 
   interpretation of data as answers to questions.
   </li>
   <li>Develop the skills necessary to read, understand, critique, and
   write about mass communication research.
   </li>
   <li>Provide an introduction to the uses of statistics.
   </li>
   <li>Cultivate analytical thinking about theory and research both in
   theory and in practice.
   </li>
</ol>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>This class is designed to introduce graduate students to the most
common scientific research methods currently used in journalism and
mass communication. It is intended to be an introduction to the
systematic study of mass communication. Hence, the emphasis of this
course is on empirical studies and will examine research that
journalists often use and write about. It will also examine research 
conducted by journalism and mass communication scholars. This
course serves as baseline preparation for your continuing work in the
graduate program by providing you with a rigorous intellectual
experience in how studies are conducted, how to assess their validity
and reliability, issues regarding appropriate use of numbers and
statistics, and their relationship to the parts of the world they
attempt to explain.</p>

<h3>Texts</h3>
<p>All required readings will be linked or made available on Canvas.
You should also stay abreast of research in your interest area by
reading appropriate scholarly and professional journals, such as:
Communication Research, Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly,
Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, Political Communication,
Public Opinion Quarterly, Journal of Communication, Journal of
Advertising, Newspaper Research Journal, Mass Communication Review</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>The class consists of weekly readings, completion of IRB certification, 
several homework assignments, a midterm exam, and a final written project.</p>

<h3>Research paper</h3>
<p>The research paper (proposal) will be on a topic chosen by you, in
consultation with me. You are strongly encouraged to meet with me
outside of class to discuss your proposed research topic. The research
paper (proposal) will be due during finals week. The research
question for your research paper (proposal) is due around the mid-point
of the course calendar. Research proposal presentations will take place
prior to finals week---at the end of the semester. Although the final
paper (research proposal) must include a **brief** summary of
pertinent literature, identification of applicable theories and a
clear statement of the value of the study, the primary emphasis will
be on research design, methods, and plan of data analyses. Details
about the paper will be forthcoming.</p>
